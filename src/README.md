# Vocal Range Detector
Determines vocal range from user audio input.

**Step 1: Base Note**
The user sings a comfortable note in the middle of their voice range.

**Step 2: Sing Higher**
The user sings from their base note up to the top of their vocal range in half step increments.

**Step 3: Sing Lower**
The user sings from their base note down to the bottom of their vocal range in half step increments.

Each note must be maintained for two seconds to be accepted. The correct pitch can be played for reference before recording. Once the user fails to maintain a note, the lowest/highest note of their vocal range will be registered.

On the results page, the user can compare their vocal range to those of various female and male voice types.
